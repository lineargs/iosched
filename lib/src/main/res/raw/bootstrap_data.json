In our new era of computing where advancements in conversational UIs and artificial intelligence are enabling users in new ways, itâ€™s easy to be tempted to take an existing visual-based app or GUI and simply â€œconvert it to voiceâ€. But while voice brings with it the potential for speed and simplicity, hands-free experiences can become overly complicated easily when based on another mode of interaction. Get the scoop on what types of use cases transfer well to voice interactions and why. ",

        "description": "It took a few years and a couple of trips around the block, but Web Components have truly arrived: theyâ€™re natively supported in Chrome and Safari today, with other browsers joining the party soon. Polymer is still the most popular way to build your own Web Components. Polymer 2.0 has been updated to the final v1 Web Components specs, getting leaner, faster and more modular along the way â€“ and offering a seamless upgrade path from Polymer 1. In this session, you will learn how Web Components and Polymer can help you build performant, maintainable web apps that unlock the full potential of the browser. Youâ€™ll also hear about the latest advancements in the Polymer library that are bringing Polymer development closer native than ever before, like ES6 class-based syntax and a suite of tools. ",

        "title": "Web Performance: Leveraging the Metrics that Most Affect User Experience",
        "description": "Performance is crucial for user engagement, especially on mobile web. Yet users are regularly bogged down by slow page loads, delayed interactivity after page load, high input latency on critical interactions (tap, click, scroll etc), and janky animations or scrolling. These negative experiences turn away users and hurt businesses.\n\nDevelopers need to measure performance in the real world to get insight into their usersâ€™ experiences on the myriad configurations of devices and networks. Unfortunately, many of the techniques used today donâ€™t capture the right metrics or make performance worse.\n\nThis talk will cover the new metrics and platform APIs that enable user-centric performance measurement, both in the lab and the real world. Weâ€™ll show how developers can track down problems, understand their root causes, and prevent future regressions to ensure users consistently get a great experience.",

This experience has been enhanced to take into account of the Android Wear form factor and design conventions.\n\nUsing the Maps API is easy. Developers can put either a MapView or a MapFragment and go from there. Compelling use cases include: local travel app, exercise app. Another way that the Maps API can do is help the user mark a greeting location on a map for a friend, a taxi or hired car driver. To do this, developers can use the CameraLocation attached to the map.\n\nFor detailed step-by-step implementations, developers can check out the Maps APIs on Android Wear blog post.

If they have a mobile website, they can optimize and make it Mobile-friendly by following our updated webmaster guidelines.  \n\nPromote content and capabilities of your site and/or app -- Developers can declare capabilities of their apps to Google through a variety of annotations. For example, Watch Action allows TV publishers to declare streamable content to Google, so Google can in turn help users discover and consume the content from their apps.  With Voice Messaging API, users can activate an app's messaging capability with voice, and interact with the app through the app's integration with Voice Interaction API. ",

This year web development gets a whole lot better thanks to the incredible power of Web Components. Our goal in this session is to show you how to use polyfills to help you realize tomorrow's web platform today. As browsers implement these new specifications, that shim layer gets smaller, better, and faster over time. We'll talk about shadow DOM, custom elements, declarative data/event binding, touch input, smooth animations, and how you can combine them to create awesome apps. Write less boilerplate, target every platform, and be more productive by using the next generation of the web platform.",
