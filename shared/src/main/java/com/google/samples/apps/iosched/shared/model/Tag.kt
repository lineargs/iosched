 * Describes a tag, which contains meta-information about a conference session. A tag has two
 * components, a category, and a name, and together these give a tag its semantic meaning. For
 * example, a session may contain the following tags: {category: "TRACK", name: "ANDROID"} and
 * {category: "TYPE", name: "OFFICEHOURS"}. The first tag defines the session track as Android, and
 * the second tag defines the session type as an office hour.
