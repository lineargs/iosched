With a few sensors and some computer vision software, your phone gets even smarter, and can start to see the world the way you do. Follow guided arrows to know which exit to take when you get off the subway, see how a sofa looks in your living room before you buy it, or watch zombies battle on your dining table. In this session, we will explore the vision of Project Tango and how it will come to life with the launch of our first consumer phone, announced earlier this year. \n",

In this talk, we will introduce you to the next level of automation using hands-on examples of industry standard tooling like Docker, a container format, and Kubernetes, a distributed automation platform. We'll cover the basics of modern day applications and how design patterns like microservices drive the need for more robust infrastructure. Then we'll cover packaging and distributing apps using Docker. Finally, we'll up our game to running applications on Kubernetes. By the end of this talk you'll have the knowledge needed to excel at scale.",

This session explains how you can use the ExoPlayer streaming media library to help provide your users with a great media experience. The talk provides an overview of the ExoPlayer's design, and highlights the advantages of ExoPlayer over other libraries such as MediaPlayer.\n\nThe ExoPlayer provides many sophisticated features such as Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH), SmoothStreaming and Common Encryption. It's designed to be easy to customize and extend, and many components can be replaced with custom implementations. Because ExoPlayer is a library that you include in your application, it can be easily updated along with your app.\n\nAfter attending this talk you'll understand how to integrate ExoPlayer into your application. If you are using it to replace MediaPlayer, this can be a quick and simple integration. However, you'll also come away with an understanding of the design and inner workings of ExoPlayer, including how to wire up ExoPlayer instances using custom components to satisfy the most demanding performance and UX requirements, as well as take full advantage of the sophisticated features provided by the player.",

How can we separate the signal from the noise, and figure out what it all means?\n\nThis talk takes a number of disparate sources of data; reddit comments, federal election disclosures, and a global event database as the raw materials to use Dataflow, Datalab, Cloud ML, and BigQuery, to extract meaning from it all. We'll find out what people are saying, in real-time, about the candidates. We'll show how to build a dashboard that can display front-runners in the campaign donation race, the reddit popularity contest, and more. \n\nYou'll see how you, too, can gain insight from disparate data sources by harnessing the suite of tools in Google's cloud.",

To enable users to quickly and easily communicate with them, we've designed the Physical Web, an open-source system that uses beacons to enable lightweight interactions with nearby devices and locations. Come listen to Ani Mohan talk about how the Physical Web uses the latest beacon and web technologies to offer a range of ways to bring interactivity to everyday scenarios. We'll also describe how developers can get started today to build Physical Web experiences.\n",
